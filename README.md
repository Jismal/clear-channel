Suggestion on improving writing feature files 

1. As i can see that scenarios are written with imperative style rather than declarative style (scenarios should largely focus on what needs to be accomplished, not the details of how it is done)
2. Not well formed english 


Highlights

1. Used selenium latest version
2. Cross browser capabilities
3. Page object model
4. Page Factory
5. Imperative style of gherkins language
